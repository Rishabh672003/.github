# Welcome to TCET Open Source

TCET Open Source aims to streamline software engineering education and development into a single organization. Kindly star our repos, if you like them. It really helps us out.

## Hacktoberfest is here!!
Please visit our [hacktoberfest website](hacktoberfest-tcetopensource.tech/) to look for repos you can work on. We highly recommend you to read our [external workflow](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/docs/resources/workflows/external-workflow/). Kindly join our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/r7ZhAREg2M) to talk to our project maintainers, for possible solutions before making a PR. This will enable both parties to be on the same page. Please make sure you are contacting the correct [team](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/#team) for a said project. (for example contact backend team's maintainers if you want to work on ERP; do not contact any other team for that)
